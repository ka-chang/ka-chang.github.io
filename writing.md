<p style="line-height:2;">Policy actors use narratives strategically to attempt to influence the political contexts in which they participate. This study employs the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) to examine policy actors' narratives around the issue of state-level school choice policy. Specifically, we seek to determine why coalitions of policy actors use a narrative strategy called the devil-angel shift. While traditional NPF hypotheses speculate that use of this strategy is driven by whether coalitions perceive themselves as policy winners or losers, recent studies suggest that use of this strategy may be better indicated by a coalition's policy position. To investigate this, we analyze legislative testimony related to two state-level senate bills that sought to enact a universal school voucher program in Nevada. We find that a coalition's policy position better reflects their use of the devil-angel shift narrative strategy over time, and we posit two potential explanations for the link between policy positions and narrative strategy.</p>

<p style="line-height:2;">Public education and public housing partnerships have grown in popularity; yet, the relationship between public education and public housing is mixed in the existing literature. Research often focuses on student outcomes exclusively, neglecting to investigate the ways multiple policy systems can impact student experiences. We examine the spatial relationship between public education and public housing in Seattle, Washington. This paper asks: 1.) What type of public schools do students living in public housing attend?; and 2.) How do the systems of public housing and public schooling distribute resources across schools? To answer these questions, we create a novel, critically informed multidimensional systems-level index and implement it using publicly available data. Findings reveal that students who live in public housing have access to schools with lower student-teacher ratios and a higher percentage of teachers of color. These findings reveal trends pointing towards public resource equality, which we contextualize in discussions alongside of educational equity.</p>
